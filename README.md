SparkFun BQ40Z50 Battery Manager Arduino Library
===========================================================

This is a library to control BQ40Z50 battery manager. A wide variety of battery pack metrics can be reported including current state of charge, individual cell voltages, time to empty, average current draw, and many others.

SparkFun does not currently sell a board that has the BQ40Z50 but does have a few products that internally utilize the IC. Therefore, being 100% feature complete is not our goal; we have implemented a handful of functions we need for the products that use the IC. We welcome PRs to expand features that users may want.
